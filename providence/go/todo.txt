- add web cam support
- daemonize process
- add an exclusion window override -- i.e. "armed mode" (requires new URL handler)
- HTTPS
- some kind of auth system for reg IDs
- smarter notification behaviors for ajar & anomalies
  - policies?
  - coalesce GCM notifications?
- add a handler for firing the physical alarm (requires ability to send to Arduino)


- DONE - handle GCM errors
- DONE - refactor into sensible Go packages
- DONE - persistence for reg IDs
- DONE - build in a heartbeat -- i.e. for phone to know that monitor is offline
- DONE - GCM details (canonical IDs, etc.)
- DONE - set the USB serial baud etc. settings so I don't have to run minicom (kludged anyway)
