These are systemd configuration files, as used on Arch, Fedora, and others.
There are two config files here: one sets up the GPIO pin control files (in
/sys/class/gpio) used by the monitor server, and the other starts up
providence itself.

To install:
$ cp *.service /etc/systemd/system
# edit the files to tweak installation paths of the compiled main.go
  executable and the gpiosetup.sh script
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable gpiosetup.service
$ sudo systemctl enable providence.service
